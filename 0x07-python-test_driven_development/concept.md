#Never forget a test

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the
intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not.
Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing
requirements contrary to the actual requirements. This tutorial will give you a
basic understanding of software testing, its types, methods, levels, and other 
related terminologies.

**Code that is not tested can’t be trusted**

### Bad reputation

* **“Testing is Too Expensive”**: Pay less for testing during software
development => pay more for maintenance or correction later. Early 
testing saves both time and cost in many aspects. However, reducing the 
cost without testing may result in improper design of a software 
application, rendering the product useless.
* **“Testing is Time-Consuming”**: Testing is never a time-consuming process.
However diagnosing and fixing the errors identified during proper testing is 
a time-consuming but productive activity.
* “Only Fully Developed Products are Tested”: No doubt, testing depends on the 
source code but reviewing requirements and developing test cases is independent 
from the developed code. However, iterative or incremental approaches to a 
development life cycle model may reduce the requirement of testing on the 
fully developed software.
